Every day, Fred takes the train to travel from his work back to Alkmaar, his place of residence. Usually, he arrives at the station of Alkmaar at six o'clock, and exactly at that moment, his wife picks him up by car. Yesterday evening, Fred took an earlier train, without informing his wife, and therefore he already was at the station of Alkmaar at five o'clock. He decided to walk part of the way to meet his wife.

If x>0, y>0, and |x| > |y|, which of the following must be true?\nOptions:\n(A) x > y\n(B) y^2 > x^2\n(C) x^3 > y^2\n(D) –x < y\n(E) x < –y	(A)	Correct Answer: (E)\nLet’s go through each answer choice: (A) can never be true, since no negative is greater than a positive. (B) doesn’t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us –x > y. Remember that x < 0, so –x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus x > y is the same statement as |x| > |y|, and (A) must be true.

If n is the smallest integer such that 432 times n is the square of an integer, what is the value of n?\nOptions:\n(A) 2\n(B) 3\n(C) 6\n(D) 12\n(E) 24	(B)	The prime factorization of a square has to have even powers of all its prime factors. If the original number has a factor, say of 7, then when it’s squared, the square will have a factor of 7^2. Another way to say that is: any positive integer all of whose prime factors have even powers must be a perfect square of some other integer. Look at the prime factorization of 432\n432 = (2^4)*(3^3)\nThe factor of 2 already has an even power —- that’s all set. The factor of 3 currently has an odd power. If n = 3, then 432*n would have an even power of 2 and an even power of 3; therefore, it would be a perfect square. Thus, n = 3 is a choice that makes 432*n a perfect square.

If x<0, y>0, and |x| < |y|, which of the following must be true?\nOptions:\n(A) x > y\n(B) y^2 > x^2\n(C) x^3 > y^2\n(D) –x < y\n(E) x < –y	(D)	Correct Answer: (E)\nLet’s go through each answer choice: (A) can never be true, since no negative is greater than a positive. (B) doesn’t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us –x > y. Remember that x < 0, so –x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus –x < y is the same statement as |x| > |y|, and (D) must be true.

In the x-y plane, point (x, y) is a lattice point if both x and y are integers. Circle C has a center at (-2, -2) and a diameter of 8. Some points, such as the center (-2, -2), are inside the circle, but a point such as (-2, 2) is on the circle but not in the circle. How many lattice points are in circle C?\nOptions:\n(A) 40\n(B) 10\n(C) 73\n(D) 60\n(E) 63	(C)	The lattice points that are in the circle that lie on the perspective axes is as follows: since the diameter is 8, 9 points lie on the horizontal axis (8 + center), but the end points are not in the circle, so 9 - 2 (the same for the vertical axis, but don't count center again), 7 - 1. The lattice points in the circle and not on the horizontal and vertical axes is as follows: lattice points can be found at 45, 45/2 and 30 degrees of axes (30 and 45/2 degrees from horizontal and vertical axes), so same numbers as before, but don't count center again. So, 13 + 5 * 12 = 73\nThere are a total of 73 lattice points in the circle.

If x<0, y<0, and |x| > |y|, which of the following must be true?\nOptions:\n(A) x > y\n(B) y^2 > x^2\n(C) x^3 > y^2\n(D) x < y\n(E) x < –y	(D)	Correct Answer: (E)\nLet’s go through each answer choice: (A) can never be true, since no negative is greater than a positive. (B) doesn’t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us –x > y. Remember that x < 0, so –x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus x < y is the same statement as |x| > |y|, and (D) must be true.

If x<0, y>0, and |x| < |y|, which of the following must be true?\nOptions:\n(A) x > y\n(B) y^2 > x^2\n(C) x^3 > y^2\n(D) –x > y\n(E) x < –y	(D)	Correct Answer: (E)\nLet’s go through each answer choice: (A) can never be true, since no negative is greater than a positive. (B) doesn’t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us –x > y. Remember that x < 0, so –x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus –x > y is the same statement as |x| > |y|, and (D) must be true.
